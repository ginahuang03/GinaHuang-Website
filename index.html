        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman at UC Riverside. I am a Pre-Business major and I am planning on doing Information Systems as my business concentration. I really enjoy my time here at UC Riverside. I live in Dundee B and my dorm is really nice. The bathrooms, showers, and gym equiptments are all very nice and my dorm building is super close to the dining hall as well. <br><br>

        Last quarter, I took BUS101 - Introduction to Business, GEO008 - Oceanography, and MATH022 - Calculus for Business. In all those classes, I got A- and above. I ended with a 3.7 GPA last quarter, which got me a spot on the Deanâ€™s Honors list. This quarter, I am taking ENG1B, CS008, DNCE005, BUS 190, and MUS008. All my classes this quarter are much easier than last quarter, but I feel like the workload is way more than last quarter.<br><br>
        Escape rooms, a time-bound fascinating adventure experience. You and your team are locked in a room, tasked with finding clues to escape. It's one of my favorite things to do. From real-life escape rooms, to escape room games on my phone. Gathering information and evidence, linking pieces of evidence to each other, and your utmost concentration is key to solving the whole puzzle, and now, you're free.

The satisfaction of finally putting two on two, and having the whole situation flow with the information I've gathered, is what I love about my skill. The skill to take existing information and evidence, to compare and contrast, and to finally come up with a conclusion. It's the best feeling ever.

Not only can I use my outstanding research, puzzling, and investigation skills on escape rooms and investigation cases, but on other topics that interest me. I am particularly interested in the business behind cosmetic lines that YouTube influencers would launch. I noticed that most of the successful and failed launches had similar patterns. Successful launches were being done by influencers that are liked by others and are inclusive with shades and formulas, while failed launches have low-quality products made by problematic influencers.

I was especially intrigued by the Jaclyn Hill cosmetics launch back in 2019. Her brand launch was the one that got the most attention in the media. The majority of complaints were regarding strange fuzzy white hairs protruding from the lipsticks, while others noticed air bubbles, holes, and even more disturbing fragments of plastic and metal. She put out a statement defending her products, but ultimately ended up refunding all customers. It still remains a mystery as to why she wasn't telling the truth, since many experts came out with evidence going against her explanations.

Over the years, this knowledge has helped me excel in doing research projects and papers, and this is where this skill comes in handy for college. I am eager to gather all the information and put it in a way that flows and makes sense, especially if it's something I'm interested in and invested in.

<br><br>

        I was born in Taiwan and I moved to the Netherlands in 2010. I grew up in the Netherlands. In January 2019, I moved from the Netherlands to San Jose, California. This transition was hard on me, but has taught me a lot. It has taught me how to be more independent, how to be more social, and I have learnt how to adapt to new situations and environments fast.
